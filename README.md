# Image Segmentation System using U-Net

## Overview

This project implements an image segmentation system based on the U-Net architecture in TensorFlow. U-Net is a convolutional neural network designed for biomedical image segmentation, but it can be applied to a wide range of segmentation tasks. The model is capable of classifying and segmenting objects within images, making it useful for applications such as medical imaging, autonomous driving, and satellite imagery analysis.

## Features

- Implementation of the U-Net architecture for image segmentation.
- Data preprocessing steps for preparing images and masks.
- Model training with adjustable hyperparameters.
- Visualization of original images and their corresponding predicted segmentation masks.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python 3.8+ and the following libraries installed:

- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using Conda:

```bash
conda create -n unet_env python=3.8
conda activate unet_env
conda install tensorflow numpy opencv matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmdmohamedd/U-net-image-segmentation.git
   cd U-net-image-segmentation
   ```

2. **Prepare Your Dataset:**

   Ensure your dataset is organized with images and corresponding masks. Update the paths in the code accordingly.

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

   You can use Jupyter Notebook to run the code:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   Open the `image_segmentation.ipynb` notebook and follow the instructions in the cells.

## Model Architecture

The U-Net architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. It uses skip connections to merge features from the encoder and decoder paths, enhancing segmentation accuracy.

## Training the Model

To train the model, you can modify the hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs in the notebook. Ensure that you have enough data to achieve good performance. 

### Example Training Code

```python
unet.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
unet.fit(train_images, train_masks, epochs=20, batch_size=16, validation_split=0.2)
```

## Visualizing Results

The project includes functionality to visualize the original images alongside their predicted segmentation masks. After training, you can generate predictions and visualize them using the following code:

```python
predicted_mask = unet.predict(test_images)
# Plot the original image and the predicted mask
```
